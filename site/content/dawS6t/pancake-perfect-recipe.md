  Malt, rather than sugar, is what sweetens most food-service (i.e., restaurant/hotel) pancake mixes. 
  For that typical "diner" taste, try malt in your pancakes instead of sugar.

## Ingredients

    2 large eggs
    1 1/4 cups (283g) milk*
    3 tablespoons (43g) melted butter or vegetable oil
    1 1/2 cups (180g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
    3/4 teaspoon salt
    2 teaspoons baking powder
    2 tablespoons (25g) granulated sugar or 1/4 cup (35g) malted milk powder
    fresh or frozen blueberries, optional

*Use 1 cup milk if you're baking under hot, humid conditions, or if you're going to let the batter rest longer than 15 minutes. Use up to 1 1/4 cups milk in cold, dry conditions.

## Instructions

    1. Beat the eggs and milk until light and foamy, about 3 minutes at high speed of a stand or hand mixer. Stir in the butter or vegetable oil.

    2. Whisk the dry ingredients together to evenly distribute the salt, baking powder and sweetener.

    3. Gently and quickly mix into the egg and milk mixture. Let the batter rest for at least 15 minutes, while the griddle is heating; it'll thicken slightly.

    4. Heat a heavy frying pan over medium heat, or set an electric griddle to 375Â°F. Lightly grease frying pan or griddle. The pan or griddle is ready if a drop of water will skitter across the surface, evaporating immediately.
    
    5. Drop 1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the lightly greased griddle. For blueberry pancakes, sprinkle the fresh or thawed frozen blueberries over the batter. (Mixing frozen blueberries into the batter before scooping will turn it blue and streaky.)
    6. Bake on one side until bubbles begin to form and break, about 2 minutes; then turn the pancakes and cook the other side until brown, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Turn over only once. Serve immediately.
